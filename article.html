            <p> Dave Roberts’ rapid ascension to World Series manager revived a question surrounding his departure from San Diego: Why didn’t the Padres interview their former bench coach for the managerial job that opened after the 2015 season and later went to Andy Green? </p>

            <p> In an interview Tuesday on The Mighty 1090, Executive Chairman Ron Fowler, while standing behind his own manager, issued the team’s most public mea culpa to date. </p>

            <p> “In retrospect, I think it was a mistake,” Fowler said. “We should’ve talked to Doc (Roberts’ nickname). … I think we as an organization own that. Personally, I regret it. I think all of us have grown, and I include (Padres General Manager A.J. Preller) in that. But we didn’t (interview Roberts), and I’m happy that Doc is having the success he’s having with the Dodgers, and I’m also very happy with the manager that we have in Andy Green.” </p>

            <p> For the record, the Padres did interview Roberts after Bud Black’s firing in June 2015. The club settled on Pat Murphy, who had no previous experience coaching in the majors, as its interim manager. </p> 

            <p> Speaking with the Union-Tribune that offseason, Preller called Roberts “a great baseball guy” but noted that he’d already interviewed Roberts in the summer. Meanwhile, the Padres approached their search for a full-time manager planning to move away from Black’s coaching tree. Roberts, who debuted as Black’s first base coach in 2011, was promoted to bench coach three years later. </p>

            <p> Many observers were critical of how the Padres handled the situation. Even if Roberts would not have been the choice, he may have deserved a second conversation. People close to the San Diego native say, following the firing of Black, a mentor, Roberts was restrained in his interview for the interim post. </p>

            <p> “I don’t think we probably gave sufficient time to Doc at that,” Fowler said. </p> 

            <p> Interviewing for his next job, Roberts reportedly wowed the Dodgers, who fielded a roster built to contend regardless of the manager. Padres ownership, meantime, continues to be impressed by Green. The skipper received a three-year extension, rare job security, in August. </p>
